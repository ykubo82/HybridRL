# Combining Backpropagation with Equilibrium Propagation to improve an Actor-Critic RL framework 
This is code to reproduce our results on Acrobot-v1 from manuscript: "Combining Backpropagation with Equilibrium Propagation to improve an Actor-Critic RL framework":

To run aecb_acrobot.py, go:

```
python aecb_acrobot.py 
```
*for this code, please install pytoch.

*This python code will create a directory "results_acrbt" to save the results (reward.npy).

To check the results, go:

```
python show_reward.py 
```
*Please move "show_reward.py" to "results_acrbt" directory, and execute above.
